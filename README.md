# (I) Abstract : 

Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. In this project we aim to analyze and identify melanoma in lesion images. Current disease diagnosis based on human labor is not only time-consuming but may prove to be inefficient as well. This endeavor of ours aims to leverage the potential of **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning** to *to successfully categorize the given melanoma image into malignant or benign*. 

Melanoma is a deadly disease, but if caught early, most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people.

This project was a part of **SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification** challenge hosted on Kaggle.
